# Customer Data Analysis in Pandas

This project uses Pandas, a popular Python library, to analyze retail customer data. I perform data analysis to answer key business questions.

## Contents

- data/: Raw CSV file containing customer data 
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks exploring the data
- src/: Python scripts for analysis
- docs/: Reports and additional files

## Getting Started
Install required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Use Python 3.

Run Jupyter notebooks in notebooks/ folder to walk through the analysis.

Scripts in src/ also perform analysis tasks.

## Business Questions

Key questions answered:

- Who are top spending customers?
- How many credit cards need renewals? 
- What are common customer professions?

And more in the notebooks!

## Data

The customer data includes information like:

- Name, email, address etc. 
- Profession and company 
- Credit card details
- Purchase amount  

Let's use the power of Python and Pandas to uncover insights from customer data!
